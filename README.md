You may find the solution and the approch of the following
requriments solution in this project.

I have made the explanation of this assesment solution in the related class.

In the first class I stored most of the methods in the same file.

In the second class almost all the operations are in the sub-methods which are store in the <Methods.class> Where 
I store under <Utuility> package.

I tried the use just like Page Object Model.




Scenario 1: User is alerted when a pipe delimited file is dropped in to a folder

o   Programmatically, create a pipe delimited csv file which contain the following fields - ID, LastName, FirstName, Gender, DOB and Address.

§  Below fields should randomly generate data under the given constraint

·         ID = between 1000 to 2000

·         Gender = M or F

·         DOB = between 1950 to 2010

§  File should be saved in location A.

o   Create a program that will poll watch the location B.

o   Then copy the csv file from location A to location B.

o   When file is copied in to location B, the program should alert the user.



·         Scenario 2:  Parse a log file for a given string and count number of its occurrences

o   Have a log file (e.g. Server.log) which contains 500 Server error.

o   Print following/next 5 lines every time you see this error including the line that shows 500 Server error

o   Write a program to count the total number of occurrences of 500 Server error in the log file

o   Logic should work for any given string.  Do not restrict your code just to “500 Server error”
